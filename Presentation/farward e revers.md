## ðŸ“Œ Structure of the distributions involved:

- The true posterior $q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0)$ is **Gaussian**:
  $$
  q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0) = \mathcal{N}\left(\tilde{\mu}_t(x_t, x_0), \tilde{\beta}_t I\right)
  $$
- The modelâ€™s reverse distribution $p_\theta(x_{t-1}|x_t)$ is also **Gaussian**:
  $$
  p_\theta(x_{t-1} | x_t) = \mathcal{N}\left(\mu_\theta(x_t, t), \sigma_\theta^2 I\right)
  $$

âœ… Thus, the KL divergence is **between two Gaussians**.




We know that:

- $x_t$ depends on $x_0$ via:

$$
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon
\quad , \quad \epsilon \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
$$

- Similarly, $x_{t-1}$ also depends on $x_0$ in a related manner.



Perfetto, hai ragione!  
Adesso correggo tutto **con attenzione**:  
deve essere chiaro che **stiamo parlando della media e varianza** della distribuzione **\(q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0)\)**,  
**non** genericamente di \(p(x|y)\).

Inoltre, ti preparo una versione **piÃ¹ precisa**, **pulita**, **aderente** al contesto dei Diffusion Models.

### âš« Deriving the Posterior \( q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0) \)

In the forward diffusion process, both \(x_t\) and \(x_{t-1}\) are obtained from the original data \(x_0\) by applying independent Gaussian noise.

Given the noised variables:

\[
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon_t
\quad , \quad \epsilon_t \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
\]

\[
x_{t-1} = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \epsilon_{t-1}
\quad , \quad \epsilon_{t-1} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)
\]

where \(\bar{\alpha}_t = \prod_{s=1}^t (1-\beta_s)\) and \(\alpha_t = 1 - \beta_t\).

### ðŸ“˜ Conditioning in the Diffusion Process

We are interested in the **posterior distribution**:

\[
q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0)
\]

Since \(x_t\) and \(x_{t-1}\) are jointly Gaussian (as linear transformations of \(x_0\) with added Gaussian noise),  
the posterior \(q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0)\) is itself Gaussian, with:

- **Mean**: a specific linear combination of \(x_0\) and \(x_t\),
- **Variance**: a function of the variances introduced by the noise schedule.

Explicitly:

\[
q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0) = \mathcal{N}\left(\tilde{\mu}_t(x_t, x_0), \tilde{\beta}_t I\right)
\]

where:

\[
\tilde{\mu}_t(x_t,x_0) = \frac{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}} \beta_t}{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_t} (1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1})}{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} x_t
\]

and

\[
\tilde{\beta}_t = \frac{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \beta_t
\]

âœ… These coefficients depend directly on the noise schedule parameters \(\beta_t\) and the cumulative products \(\bar{\alpha}_t\), ensuring a consistent modeling of the forward process.

### ðŸ“˜ Why is the Mean a Linear Combination?

This happens because:
- In a jointly Gaussian system, conditioning one variable on another results in a new Gaussian distribution.
- The **mean of the conditional** is a **linear combination** of the variables' means, corrected by their covariances.
- In the diffusion setting, this naturally leads to \(\tilde{\mu}_t\) being a weighted sum of \(x_0\) and \(x_t\).

âœ… Specifically:
- \(x_0\) carries information about the original data,
- \(x_t\) carries information about the current noisy state,
- The posterior \(q(x_{t-1} | x_t, x_0)\) balances these two sources based on how much noise has been injected.

# ðŸ”¥ Quick Conceptual Summary

| Term | Meaning |
|:---|:---|
| \(\tilde{\mu}_t(x_t, x_0)\) | Weighted average of \(x_0\) and \(x_t\) based on how much noise has been added |
| \(\tilde{\beta}_t\) | Adjusted variance after conditioning on \(x_0\) |
| Why linear? | Because the system is jointly Gaussian and linearly dependent on \(x_0\) |

Would you also like me to write a short **mathematical derivation** showing exactly how to go from the joint distribution of \((x_t, x_{t-1})\) to these \(\tilde{\mu}_t\) and \(\tilde{\beta}_t\) formulas using covariance matrices? ðŸš€  
It would complete your understanding at a fully formal level!

Shall we proceed? ðŸŽ¯âœ¨
