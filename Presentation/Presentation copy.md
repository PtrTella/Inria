Ottima richiesta!  
Adesso ti preparo una **versione compatta**, **fluida**, **chiara**,  
pronta per essere usata in una presentazione o slide deck.

SarÃ :

- **Lineare** (senza salti logici),
- **Pulita** (pochi simboli alla volta),
- **In inglese corretto**,
- **Focalizzata sulla derivazione** dalla loss con \(\tilde{\mu}_t\) alla Simple Loss.

# ðŸ“‘ Slide-ready Compact Derivation (in English)

### ðŸ”¹ From Posterior Mean Matching to Noise Prediction

---

### 1. Objective: Match Posterior Means

We aim to minimize the discrepancy between the true posterior mean \(\tilde{\mu}_t\) and the model's predicted mean \(\mu_\theta\):

\[
\mathcal{L} = \mathbb{E}_q \left[ \|\tilde{\mu}_t(x_t, x_0) - \mu_\theta(x_t, t)\|^2 \right]
\]

---

### 2. Expanding \(\tilde{\mu}_t(x_t, x_0)\)

The true posterior mean can be written as a linear combination:

\[
\tilde{\mu}_t(x_t, x_0) = c_1(t) \, x_0 + c_2(t) \, x_t
\]

where \(c_1(t)\) and \(c_2(t)\) are coefficients depending on the noise schedule.

---

### 3. Expressing \(x_0\) in Terms of \(x_t\) and \(\epsilon\)

From the forward process:

\[
x_t = \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t} x_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
x_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}} \left( x_t - \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t} \epsilon \right)
\]

---

### 4. Substituting \(x_0\) into \(\tilde{\mu}_t\)

After substitution, \(\tilde{\mu}_t\) becomes:



---

### 6. Simplifying the Loss

When subtracting \(\tilde{\mu}_t - \mu_\theta\):

- The terms involving \(x_t\) cancel out,
- Only the terms involving \(\epsilon\) and \(\epsilon_\theta\) remain.

Thus:

\[
\tilde{\mu}_t(x_t, x_0) - \mu_\theta(x_t, t) \propto \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)
\]

---

### 7. Final Simple Loss

Minimizing the posterior mean error is equivalent to minimizing the noise prediction error:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{simple}} = \mathbb{E}_{x_0, t, \epsilon} \left[ \|\epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(x_t, t)\|^2 \right]
\]

âœ… The model is trained purely to predict the added noise!

# ðŸ”¥ Notes for speaking:

- Emphasize that **noise prediction is easier and more stable** than predicting absolute pixel values.
- Highlight that this **reparameterization trick** is the core insight that makes DDPMs effective.
